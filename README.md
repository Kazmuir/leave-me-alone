# Leave Me Alone!

Hi! We are comet, and we help freelance developers have a fulfilling life, one **problem solved** at a time.

## What is this?

Lots of engineers from our community complained about unsolicited messages and connections on LinkedIn. So we developed Leave Me Alone (LMA), a Chrome extension to help you clear the noise.

It will **clean your LinkedIn pending invitations** and **contact list** in record time, based on configurable keywords and job titles.

## How do I install this

### Chrome Web Store

LMA is officially available to the public. Just go to [the Chrome Web Store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njiepoekepkkokbfddjfdnkokkkiobde) and install it like you would any other extension.

### Developer mode

The developer mode allows you to install arbitrary extensions as ZIP files. It first needs to be authorized in Chrome, by going to the [Chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/) page and checking the `Developer mode` switch :

You can then get the latest version by :
- Fetching it from the [releases page](https://github.com/hellocomet/leave-me-alone/releases) and unzipping it to a new folder
- or just cloning this repository

You then need to click the `Load unpacked` button, and select the folder where the extension is :

## How do I contribute

Leave Me Alone is developed in glorious VanillaJS, HTML and CSS. Just fork the project, make your changes, and submit a Pull Request! We will happily review it as soon as possible!

To easily test your changes, you should install the extension in Developer Mode. Changes to the code will be taken into account immediately without reinstalling.

Alternatively, you can always [submit an issue](https://github.com/hellocomet/leave-me-alone/issues) if you notice any bug, or if you wish to request a new feature!
